# About
# Me
I have a B.S. in Data Science with a particular interest in Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. 


My passions for physics and astronomy, conservation, sustainability, and politics have always been a driving force in the datasets I choose to work with. These fields inspired me to pursue Data Science, as opposed to a more traditional Computer Science path. I firmly believe that the vast amount of data available can have a positive impact on our systems and society, if we can figure out how to analyze, build on, and communicate it effectively. As a result, I am eager to take on new challenges that can help to achieve these goals.

# Technical Skills
 I have experience working with various platforms and programming languages, with a particular preference for Python. My portfolio reflects my expertise in Python and its libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Astropy, Sklearn, Folium, among others. I am also proficient in SAS, SQL, Java, HTML/Javascript, and various visualization platforms.
