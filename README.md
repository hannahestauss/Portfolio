# About
# Me
I'm originally from Dallas, TX and completing graduating from the New York City College of Technology in December 2023 with a B.S. in Data Science and a minor in Physics. Over the course of my educational career, I've become particularly interested in NLP, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning, especially as it relates to phyiscs and astronomy. I've found that each time I dive into a new project, I'm fascinated by new codes, motivated by challenges, and excellent at teachning myself the necessary skills for individual project goals. Although I'm just beginning my professional career, my academic perfomance reflects my eagerness to take projects and assignments to higher levels of complexity and performance that I'm excited to apply to future career placements. 

I have passions for physics and astronomy, conservation, sustainability, and politics that often drive the datasets I choose to work with. These fields inspired me to pursue Data Science, as opposed to a more traditional Computer Science. We have more data than ever, and I believe that data has the power to change our systems and society for the better if we can figure out how to analyze, build on, and communicate it effectively. 

# Technical Skills
